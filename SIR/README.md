# SIR 
## SIR Coupling of dynamics and spatial propagation
## Version 0.1 Dr. Ralf Wieland

The model consists of the following components:
1. space_simu.py    
2. time_simu.py
3. model1.py  **starts teh simulation**
4. read_temperature (help function to read the temperature from a file)
5. visualize_log.py **visualize the results**

The data is under data and is data of the DWD and previous modelling steps

The model uses the following Python modules, which have to be installed:

* pandas
* numpy
* pylab
* osgeo
* scipy
* pickle
